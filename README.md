# XGBoost_ModelTraining
For XGBoost Model training to integrate with BBE (Bristol Betting Exchange)

## This code is intended to be used with https://github.com/ChawinT/XGBoost_TBBE as part of A XGBoost-Agent Based model in In-Play Betting on a Sports Betting Exchange dissertation. 

The main purpose of this code is for Pre-processing data from  https://github.com/ChawinT/XGBoost_TBBE, train xgboost model and evaluate the performance using hypothesis testing of the XGBoost agent against other agents from the data collected from BBE

Main code: 
1) xgbosstTraining.ipynb
   
   The Preprocessing + Training of the model. Details are in the 'Markdown' and commented section of the code.

3) StatTest100.ipynb
   
   This code is for statistical hypothesis testing for testing scenario 1 of the dissertation.

5) StatTest5.ipynb
   
   This code is for statistical hypothesis testing for testing scenario 2 of the dissertation.

7) Others
   
   Result files generated from 1,2,3

## This github doens't contain training data due to a large file size. The training data can be collect from running sessions in https://github.com/ChawinT/XGBoost_TBBE using the setup in the dissertation.
